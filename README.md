# SDLTest
Test to get basic understanding and started with SDL2 

The main program was made mainly following Lazy Foo's tutorial in 
http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

The delay part in the original code was changed to get it working on MacOSX (The original did not show the window).

Also the test project's purpose was to find out how to install SDL into applications subdirectory and compile and link it from there (with make).
